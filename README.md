# rock-paper-scissors

This will be my first project revisiting the essentials of JS all thanks to Odin Project.

I finally managed to make an interface to the game and i just loved it.
I used Pico.css as a framework and it help me a lot. Maybe I'll come back to this project one day to implement new features...
